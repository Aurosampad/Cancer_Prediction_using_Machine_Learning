This is a very basic project which I have done with the purpose of integrating it with an app called Oncogemsfor Cancer Prediction.Here I have used a very simple and easy-to-learn dataset for Cancer detection.I have used the Random Forest Classifier model for predicting it and got an accuracy of 99%.The main challenge lied in the fact that there were multiple columns of which needed to be get rid of and so I have used various pre-processing techniques for cleaning them.There were also many null values in those columns which I have replaced with the least occuring values in those columns.I have also checked for the presence of any Outliers and have removed them for keeping the dataset balanced.I have used the concept of One-hot encoding to encode the required string variables and make them compatible with other variables in the dataset.
